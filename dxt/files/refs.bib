  abstract = {BACKGROUND Revision TKA less consistently produces improvements in clinical function and quality of life when compared with primary TKA. The reasons for this difference are unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We determined differences in patient-reported outcomes and rates of satisfaction between primary and revision TKAs, and determine whether the reason for revision influences patient-reported outcomes after revision TKA. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for 24,190 patients (23,393 TKAs; 797 aseptic revision TKAs). We compared patient-reported outcomes using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol (EQ-5D), and patient satisfaction between primary TKA and revision TKA, and for subsets of the revision TKA cohort. The followup data were collected between 6 and 12 months (7 months average) postoperatively. RESULTS Improvements in the OKS (10) and EQ-5D (0.231) were smaller after revision when compared with primary TKA (OKS, 15; EQ-5D, 0.303). Patients who had revision TKA were less satisfied (66\% versus 83\%). Revisions for aseptic loosening or lysis were associated with the best patient outcomes (OKS improvement = 11; EQ-5D improvement = 0.232; satisfaction = 72\%). Revisions for stiffness had the worst results (OKS improvement = 6; EQ-5D improvement = 0.176; satisfaction = 47\%). CONCLUSIONS The early improvements in knee function and general health after revision TKA are only 69\% to 76\% of those observed for primary TKA. Levels of patient-reported knee function, general health, and satisfaction after revision are varied and related to the reason for revision. Even the best revision group does not approach the levels of function and satisfaction observed after primary TKA at a mean of 7 months postoperatively. Longer-term followup would be required to determine whether conclusions from these early data will need to be modified. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level III, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

  abstract = {Background: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a devastating complication. The short-term morbidity profile of revision TKA performed for PJI relative to non-PJI revisions is poorly characterized. The purpose of this study is to determine 30-day postoperative outcomes after revision TKA for PJI, relative to primary TKA and aseptic revision TKA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2015 was queried for primary and revision TKA cases. Revision TKA cases were categorized into PJI and non-PJI cohorts. Differences in 30-day outcomes including postoperative complications, readmissions, operative time, and length of stay were compared using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: In total, 175,761 TKAs were included in this study, with 162,981 (92.7\%) primary TKAs and 12,780 (7.3\%) revision TKAs, of which 2196 (17.2\%) revisions were performed for PJI. When compared to aseptic revision TKA, multivariate analysis demonstrated that PJI revisions had a significantly higher risk of major early postoperative complications including death (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.25) and sepsis (OR 8.73). In addition, nonhome discharge (OR 1.75), readmissions (OR 1.67), and length of stay (+2.1 days) were all greater relative to non-PJI revisions. Conclusion: Utilizing a large, prospectively collected, national database, we found that revision TKA for PJI has a greater risk of short-term morbidity and mortality and requires a higher utilization of healthcare resources. These results have implications for patient counseling and alternative payment models that may eventually include revision TKA.},

  abstract = {Aims The James Lind Alliance aims to bring patients, carers, and clinicians together to identify uncertainties regarding care. A Priority Setting Partnership was established by the British Association for Surgery of the Knee in conjunction with the James Lind Alliance to identify research priorities related to the assessment, management, and rehabilitation of patients with persistent symptoms after knee arthroplasty. Methods The project was conducted using the James Lind Alliance protocol. A steering group was convened including patients, surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses, physiotherapists, and researchers. Partner organizations were recruited. A survey was conducted on a national scale through which patients, carers, and healthcare professionals submitted key unanswered questions relating to problematic knee arthroplasties. These were analyzed, aggregated, and synthesized into summary questions and the relevant evidence was checked. After confirming that these were not answered in the current literature, 32 questions were taken forward to an interim prioritization survey. Data from this survey informed a shortlist taken to a final consensus meeting. Results A total of 769 questions were received during the initial survey with national reach across the UK. These were refined into 32 unique questions by an independent information specialist. The interim prioritization survey was completed by 201 respondents and 25 questions were taken to a final consensus group meeting between patients, carers, and healthcare professionals. Consensus was reached for ranking the top ten questions for publication and dissemination. Conclusions The top ten research priorities focused on pain, infection, stiffness, health service configuration, surgical and non-surgical management strategies, and outcome measures. This list will guide funders and help focus research efforts within the knee arthroplasty community.},
